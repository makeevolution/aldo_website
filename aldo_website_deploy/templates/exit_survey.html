					During the pandemic lockdown I took an online course on data analysis for the purpose of
					expanding my skill set. I applied this knowledge by analyzing exit survey data of
					workers that work for employment and education institutes of the Australian Government.
					This course gave me new insights on how to filter a given dataset in order to extract only
					information of interest. In addition, it teaches me on how to handle missing data when applying
					statistical analysis to an incomplete dataset.
					Below is a preliminary report that shows the code and findings. I intend to expand this analysis in the near future.
