                    When leaving the house and saying "turn on camera" to Google Home, camera will be turned on.
                    When the camera detects motion, the camera will capture
                    a picture and send it to a client email, notifying me that someone is in the house.
                    Motion is detected using frame difference technique, with the reference frame being
                    updated every 5 seconds (determined by trial and error) to ensure robustness of the system.
                    Upon arrival at home, simply say "turn off camera" to turn off the camera. An implementation
                    is shown in the video below:
